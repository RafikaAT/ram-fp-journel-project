# Journal Entry Project

## Team Members: Max, Rafika and Akash

## Installation and Usage:

### Installation:

1. Clone or download this repo from Github.
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the repo.
3. Run `npm install` to install the relevant dependencies such that the code will run successfully.

### Usage:

1. Now would be a good idea to open up a separate terminal so that client side and server side operations can run in unison.
2. Navigate to the server folder in the repo and in the terminal run the command `npm run dev`
3. Whilst step 2 is running please in the OTHER terminal you should have open, navigate to the client folder and run the same command `npm run dev`
4. The website should have opened and you should be free to experience the website. Enjoy! ☺️

## Wins:

- Planning with notion board really helped speed up the process working, we did not waste time trying to figure out what to do, as there was already tasks on the board.
- Backend routes and requests to the server were implemented and functioning in the way we intended them too.
- Frontend journal entry submission form is operating which shows the whole website coming together really nicely.
- Not many merger conflicts, which shows how well our communication is when it came to working, updating code.
- GiphyAPI implemented and works!
- POST form works.

## Challenges:

- Some of the challenges we ran into, was mainly github issues, sometimes when trying to try a `git pull`, it would lead to some errors, which would halt progress in terms of working in our own personal development environment. Quick fix around this, was to focus on tasks that required multiple people and then one screenshares, and this allows for some collaboration until the issue gets fixed.
- Some of the more challenges faced by some of the team members, is being abit reluctant of starting the task, the fear of not knowing what to do was holding them back, when infact in reality, they did know what to do, just needed to think of a pseudo code, try their logic and then troubleshoot. This was overcame by support from our senior developer who motivated and inspired.
